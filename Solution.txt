Part 1: Verify Connectivity
Step 1: Trace the path to the Web Server from PC-A.

Which devices are on the path from PC-A to the Web Server? 
Use the addressing table to determine the device names.

	  1   0 ms      0 ms      0 ms      192.168.1.1
	  2   0 ms      0 ms      0 ms      10.1.1.2
	  3   *         0 ms      0 ms      10.100.100.2
	  4   *         0 ms      0 ms      209.165.200.226

	R1 (1), R2 (2), I-Net (3) --> Webserver (4)

Part 1
Step 2: Trace the path to the Web Server from PC-B.

Which devices are on the path from PC-B to the Web Server?

	  1   0 ms      0 ms      0 ms      192.168.1.3
	  2   *         *         0 ms      10.1.1.2
	  3   0 ms      0 ms      0 ms      10.100.100.2
	  4   0 ms      0 ms      0 ms      209.165.200.226
	R3 (1), R2 (2), I-Net (3) --> Webserver (4)

Part 1
Step 3: Observe the network behavior when R3 becomes unavailable.

	1   *         *         *         Request timed out.
	.
	.
	.

	30   *         *         *         Request timed out.

	The PC could not find a path.
	**
	After reconnecting the ping is successful.

Part 2: Configure HSRP Active and Standby Routers
Step 1: Configure HSRP on R1.

	en
	conf t
	interface g0/1
	standby version 2
	standby 1 ip 192.168.1.254
	standby 1 priority 150
	standby 1 preempt
	end
	copy run start


What will the HSRP priority of R3 be when it is added to HSRP group 1?

	It will be the default value which is 100.

Part 2
Step 2: Configure HSRP on R3.

	en
	conf t
	int g0/0
	standby version 2
	standby 1 ip 192.168.1.254
	end
	copy run start



Part 2
Step 3: Verify HSRP Configuration

	R1 && R3:
	show standby

Which router is the active router?

	R1 becuase it has a priority of 150

What is the MAC address for the virtual IP address?

	0000.0C9F.F001

What is the IP address and priority of the standby router?

	Since R3 has a priority of 100 and R1 has a priority of 150
	R3 is the standby router which is proven by show standby on R1
	it has the IP of R3 and its priority, but on R3 the standby router is LOCAL.
IP: 192.168.1.3
Priority: 100

Change the default gateway address for PC-A, PC-C, S1, and S3. (I think it means PC-B)
Which address should you use?

	192.168.1.254 becuase in part 2, step 1, c we configured this IP as the IP of the virtual default
	gateway.
	
	On S1 && S3:
		en
		conf t
		ip default-gateway 192.168.1.254
		end
		copy run start

	On PC-A and PC-C we change it from the GUI (I think it means PC-B)
	1) Double click on the required PC
	2) open IP Configuration
	3) Change the Default Gateway from 192.168.1.3 to 192.168.1.254
	4) Do 1-3 on the other PC


Verify the new settings. 
Issue a ping from both PC-A and PC-C to the Web Server. Are the pings successful? (I think it means PC-B)

	ping 209.165.200.226

	PC-A: Yes
	PC-B: Yes


	

Part 3: Observe HSRP Operation
Step 1: Make the active router become unavailable.

Does the path differ from the path used before HSRP was configured?

	  1   0 ms      0 ms      0 ms      192.168.1.1
	  2   0 ms      0 ms      0 ms      10.1.1.2
	  3   0 ms      0 ms      0 ms      10.100.100.2
	  4   0 ms      0 ms      0 ms      209.165.200.226

	R1 (1), R2 (2), I-NET (3) ---> Webserver (4)
	So the asnwer is yes, the first hop is R1 and NOT R3, (R1 has a higher priority)

Part 3
Step 2: Break the link to R1.

How was this trace different from the previous trace?

	  1   *         0 ms      0 ms      192.168.1.3
	  2   *         *         *         Request timed out.
	  3   *         0 ms      0 ms      10.100.100.2
	  4   0 ms      0 ms      3 ms      209.165.200.226

	C:\> tracert 209.165.200.226

	Tracing route to 209.165.200.226 over a maximum of 30 hops: 

	  1   0 ms      0 ms      0 ms      192.168.1.3
	  2   0 ms      0 ms      0 ms      10.1.1.2
	  3   0 ms      0 ms      0 ms      10.100.100.2
	  4   0 ms      0 ms      0 ms      209.165.200.226

	It was a slow start, and we can see above the first hop is back to R3 since
	connection to R1 got deleted, but on the second time I ran the command, it worked find and fast


HSRP undergoes a process to determine which router should take over when the active router becomes unavailable. 
This process takes time. Once the process is complete, 
the R3 standby router becomes active and is used as the default gateway for hosts on LAN 1 and LAN 2.

Part 3
Step 3: Restore the link to R1


What path is used to reach the Web Server?
	R1 (1), R2 (2), I-NET (3) ---> Webserver (4)

	  1   0 ms      2 ms      0 ms      192.168.1.3
	  2   *         *         *         Request timed out.
	  3   0 ms      0 ms      0 ms      10.100.100.2
	  4   0 ms      2 ms      0 ms      209.165.200.226

	Trace complete.

	C:\> tracert 209.165.200.226
	
	Tracing route to 209.165.200.226 over a maximum of 30 hops: 

	  1   0 ms      0 ms      0 ms      192.168.1.1
	  2   0 ms      0 ms      0 ms      10.1.1.2
	  3   0 ms      0 ms      0 ms      10.100.100.2
	  4   0 ms      0 ms      0 ms      209.165.200.226

	The first time I ran the command it was a slow run and it stayed the same as before, but the second
	time it changed back to R1 since it has a higher priority.

If the preempt command was not configured for the HSRP group on R1, would the results have been the same?

	Since preempt command was used, R1 will regain its role if and when it becomes available
	and since we restored the connection R1 will regain its original role as the gateway router 
	sicne it has the higher priorty.
	
	if the command was not used the result would have been
	
	R3 (1), R2 (2), I-Net (3) --> Webserver (4)

	Instead of 

	R1 (1), R2 (2), I-NET (3) ---> Webserver (4)

	So that means the results would not have been the same!
